# Why Deep Learning and Why Now?

### Why Deep Learning?
Hand engineered features are time consuming, brittle, and not scalable in practice. 

- We can learn the underlying features directly from data!

### Why Now?

Neaural Networks data back decades, so why the dominace now?

Today, we have the resources 
1. Big Data
   - Larger datasets
   - Easier collection and storage
2. Hardware
   - GPUs
   - Massively parallelizable
3. Software
   - Improved techniques
   - New models
   - Toolboxes
