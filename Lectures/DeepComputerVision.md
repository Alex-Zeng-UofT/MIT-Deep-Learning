## Learning Visual Features

Converting an image to oen dimension vector and processing it with a traditional fully connected neural network is not feasible due to loss of the spacial and geometrical respresentation of the image

### Convolution

> Use convolution to first iteratively process and compress the image before sending it off to a fully connected neural network
